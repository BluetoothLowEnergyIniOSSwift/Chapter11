# Bluetooth Low Energy iOS Swift

## Chapter 11: Project: iBeacon


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Scan for iBeacons and determine Central's position relative to nearby iBeacons
* Peripheral: Create an iBeacon
